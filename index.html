        <p class="overview">Hello! My name is Meagan, you can call me Meg if you want. I am a freelance graphic designer, I have two sons, and I love animals. I hope I can use my code to make a difference in the world!</p>
    
        <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
        <p>I have been interested in code since I was in middle school. I used to spend hours after school building simple webpages on Geocities about my pets, or any other random interest I had. I'm excited to have the opportunity to learn code like a professional!</p>
        <p>I have been looking at Grand Circus since 2015, and I knew it was right for me. I just needed the opportunity to finally go for it. I have two friends who completed Grand Circus a few years ago, and they are both doing very well and highly recommend the program.</p>
